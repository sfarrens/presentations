## Linting

--

> Now, we have a pretty solid workflow for developing new featues for our code and testing them. To keep things clean and consistent we can add another step to the workflow called *linting*.

> Linters are tools that automatically check code style and standards (against a given convention).

--

> Technically, we already implemented a form of linting into our unit tests (see [previous section](#/5)) when we used `pytest-pydocstyle`. However, this only covers documentation standards that will be covered in the [next section](#/7).

> One community standard linter for Python is [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/). Black automatically reformats the code style to ensure consistency throughout the entire code base.

--

> We can easily run Black on our example code to update the formatting.

```bash
black mycosmo
```

> The linter will inform us which files were modified.

--

> If you are particularly strict about your code formatting 🧐, you can also use tools like [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to organise the order modules are imported.

```bash
isort mycosmo
```

> Again, the linter will inform us which files were modified.

--

> There are many similar tools available for other standards and/or languages. The most important thing is to identify the tools that fit into your workflow for the standards you want to adhere to.
