## Continuous integration and deployment I
### GitHub Actions

--

> At this stage our code is looking pretty good! We have documentation and tests all set up, but we do have to build the documentation and run the tests manually. ðŸ˜©

> This means we might get lazy and forget to run our tests before merging or indeed to update our documentation afterwards. ðŸ˜¨

> This is where the concept of *continuous integration* (CI, i.e. constantly running tests) and *continuous deployment* (CD, i.e. constantly deploying things like API documentation) comes into play.

--

> Both GitHub and GitLab provide tools to automatically run tests and deploy static HTML pages.

> Let's start with GitHub, which offers CI/CD services via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

> To begin we will need to create a *YAML* file for CI and put it in `.github/workflows`. This file can have any name, but let's call it `ci.yml` for now.

```bash
mkdir .github/workflows
touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

--

> Inside this file we will add the following.

```yml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
     - main
```

> This specifies that the workflow is called `CI` and that it should only run if we open a pull request to the `main` branch.

--

> Next we will add the following.

```yml
jobs:
  test-full:
    name: Run CI Tests
    runs-on: ${{ "{{" }} matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]
        python-version: ["3.11"]

```

> This specifies that within the workflow we want to run a job called *Run CI Tests* on both Ubuntu and macOS machines using Python 3.11.[$^{17}$](#/13/18)

--

> Now we can add some steps to our job.

```yml
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python ${{ "{{" }} matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ "{{" }} matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Check Python version
        run: python --version
```

> This will checkout our repository, set up Python and check that the correct version is being used.

--

> Next we will install the packages we need for running our tests.

```yml
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: python -m pip install numpy pytest pytest-cov pytest-emoji pytest-pydocstyle
```

> Finally, we will run the tests.

```yml
      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m pytest --verbose --emoji --pydocstyle --cov=mycosmo mycosmo 
```

--

## Exercise

> Push your CI workflow to the `main` branch, then open a new branch, implement any changes you like and open a PR. 

> Did your CI jobs run?

--

> Now, let's add a CD workflow. As [before](#/7/2), we will add a new YAML file, this time called `cd.yml`.

> At the top of the file we will add the following.

```yml
name: CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
     - main
```

> This specifies that the workflow is called `CD` and that it should only run if we push changes to the `main` branch.[$^{18}$](#/13/19)

--

> As we are just deploying our API docs, we only need one machine for our job.[$^{19}$](#/13/20)

```yml
jobs:
  docs:
    name: Deploy API Documentation
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

--

> The first three steps of this job are exactly the same as the [CI job](#/7/5).

> Then we will install the packages we need for building our API documentation.

```yml
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: python -m pip install myst-parser numpy numpydoc sphinx sphinx-book-theme
```

--

> Next, we need to build our docs, exactly as we did locally [before](#/6/8).

```yml
      - name: Build API documentation
        run: |
          sphinx-apidoc -Mfeo docs/source mycosmo
          sphinx-build docs/source docs/build
```

--

> Last but not least, we need to deploy our API documentation so the whole world can see it.[$^{20}$](#/13/21) ðŸ¥¹

```yml
      - name: Deploy API documentation
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3.5.9
        with:
          github_token: ${{ "{{" }} secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: docs/build
```

--

> To get this CD workflow to work we will need to set up a few things on GitHub. Let's create a special branch called `gh-pages`.[$^{21}$](#/13/22)

```bash
git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git reset --hard
git commit --allow-empty -m "Initializing gh-pages branch"
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout main
```

> Then on GitHub go to

<mermaid>
graph LR;
    a["Settings"]
    b["General"]
    c["Workflow permissions"]
    a --> b --> c
</mermaid>
<!-- .element: style="height: 100px;" -->

> and select *Read and write permissions*.

## Exercise

> Push your CD workflow to the `main` branch.

> Did your CD job run? Can you see your API documentation at `<user name>.github.io/example`?
